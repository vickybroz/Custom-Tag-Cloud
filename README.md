# WP-Custom-Tag-Cloud
A wordpress function to form a tag cloud but just from the tags in an specific taxonomy term.

This is a function to form the classic wordpress tag cloud but just with the tags of an specific taxonomy term.


For example if you have a blog and you have your posts devided in different categories like: Movies, sports, economy and you don't want to show the Economy tags on the Movie's page.

Hopes it's useful for you!
